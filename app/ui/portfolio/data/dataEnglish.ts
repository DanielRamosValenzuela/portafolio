      'I worked for SMU for 2 years, where I was solely a backend developer in the payment methods team. I integrated and supported various payment methods such as: Transfer (ETPAY), Transbank, GiftCard, Unipay, Klap, etc. Additionally, I integrated these payment methods into an ecommerce platform called VTEX. We had an app in which we could visualize the transactions, which was built with React and NextJs. Since it was a private company, the code and GitHub are also private.',
